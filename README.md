# SillyTavern Backup Guide

## Overview

`Backup.bat` is a simple and effective batch script designed exclusively for Windows. As a Batch file, it takes advantage of Windows functionalities to keep your SillyTavern data safe. It efficiently packs your crucial files into a compressed format using either 7-Zip (optional) or built-in compression.

## Requirements

1. **Windows Only:** This script is designed exclusively for Windows operating systems. Due to its nature as a Batch file, it will not work on other operating systems.

2. **Get 7-Zip (Optional):** 7-Zip is an optional requirement for additional compression options. Download it [here](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html). If 7-Zip is not installed, the backup script seamlessly switches to using the built-in compression for creating a ZIP file with the same functionality.

3. **Location Matters:** Place the `Backup.bat` file in your SillyTavern folder.
